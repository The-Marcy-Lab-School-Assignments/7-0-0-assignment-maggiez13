# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer
The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state. 

The current state value is the current value of the state that you have initialized. It will update whenever the state changes. 

The function is a setter function that you call to update the state. When you call this function with a new state value, React will re-render the component with the updated state. 

```jsx
const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState("Good Morning");
```
In this example, `greeting` is the current state value and `setGreeting` is the setter function. 

When `useState("Good Morning)` is called, `greeting` is initialized with the value "Good Morning."

The function `setGreeting` will update the state and trigger a re-render of the component with the new state value. 

For example, if we click on the Spanish button, `greeting` will be updated to "Buenos Dias" and React will re-render the component to display the change in the UI.
