# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
When the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked, it updates the current state. React schedules an update to the state with the new value provided or calculated by a function. This triggers a re-render of the component, where the UI is updated to reflect the new state.
